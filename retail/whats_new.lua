[[
 - TOC bump
 - Fixed bug when mount names weren't available after Hearthing
 - Performance improvements
 - Hearth toys default to Favourites only
 - Temporarily removed ToyBox button
 - Reworked lots of stuff so buttons with toys (like Hearth) are more reliable
 - If you're still having issues with settings being lost or bars/buttons missing,
         please attach your saved variables to an issue so I can see them
 - I'm not playing WoW, so if things are missing make sure you report them.
